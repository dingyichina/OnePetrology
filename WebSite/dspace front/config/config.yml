# Theme Config
themes:
  # Add additional themes here. In the case where multiple themes match a route, the first one
  # in this list will get priority. It is advisable to always have a theme that matches
  # every route as the last one
  #
  # # A theme with a handle property will match the community, collection or item with the given
  # # handle, and all collections and/or items within it
  # - name: 'custom',
  #   handle: '10673/1233'
  #
  # # A theme with a regex property will match the route using a regular expression. If it
  # # matches the route for a community or collection it will also apply to all collections
  # # and/or items within it
  # - name: 'custom',
  #   regex: 'collections\/e8043bc2.*'
  #
  # # A theme with a uuid property will match the community, collection or item with the given
  # # ID, and all collections and/or items within it
  # - name: 'custom',
  #   uuid: '0958c910-2037-42a9-81c7-dca80e3892b4'
  #
  # # The extends property specifies an ancestor theme (by name). Whenever a themed component is not found
  # # in the current theme, its ancestor theme(s) will be checked recursively before falling back to default.
  # - name: 'custom-A',
  #   extends: 'custom-B',
  #   # Any of the matching properties above can be used
  #   handle: '10673/34'
  #
  # - name: 'custom-B',
  #   extends: 'custom',
  #   handle: '10673/12'
  #
  # # A theme with only a name will match every route
  # name: 'custom'
  #
  # # This theme will use the default bootstrap styling for DSpace components
  # - name: BASE_THEME_NAME
  #
  - name: dde
